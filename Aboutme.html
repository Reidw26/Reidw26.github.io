          <h1><center><b>More About Me</b></center></h1>
          <p>My name is Reid Wheeler. My life has been based out of Missouri for nearly 20 year. I am proud to call Kansas City my home and will talk about the Chiefs all day long. I am currently a student at the University of Missouri majoring in economics. In my free time here I work in a financial office as a financial coach for other students around me. Below I will link more on my office and what we do.
              If I am not at school you can probably catch me on the golf course or watching just about any sporting even known to man.
